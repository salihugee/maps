I'll continue updating the weather utility file and other files that contain API URLs. Let's update the weather.ts file: 
```


Made changes.

Let's also check the companies page: 

Let's create a services directory to handle all API calls and use environment variables: 

Made changes.



Now let's update the Map component to use the new API service: 
```

Now let's add the .env file to .gitignore to ensure sensitive information isn't committed: 
```


Made changes.

I've made several changes to properly handle environment variables:

1. Created/Updated .env file with:
   - API URLs
   - API keys
   - Other configuration values

2. Created .env.example as a template for other developers

3. Created a new `services/api.ts` file to centralize API calls with:
   - Company CRUD operations
   - Consistent error handling
   - Environment variable usage

4. Updated the weather utility to use environment variables

5. Updated the Map component to use the new API service

6. Added proper TypeScript types for environment variables

7. Added .env to .gitignore for security

To use these changes, developers will need to:

1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Fill in their own API keys and configuration
3. Use the api service for making API calls

Let me know if you need any adjustments or have questions about the implementation!
